# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities using a public GitHub issue. If you believe you've found a security issue, please contact me through one of the following methods:

- https://github.com/structurify/structurify/security/advisories
- Alternatively, through mailing list: kontakt+structurify@marcinmrotek.pl

I do not currently have a bounty program in place, so I cannot offer monetary rewards for any reported problems.

Whichever method you choose, you will be credited as the reporter once the announcement is published.
